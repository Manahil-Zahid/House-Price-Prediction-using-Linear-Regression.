# House Price Prediction using Linear Regression  

This project demonstrates a simple **Linear Regression model** to predict house prices based on house size.  
It is a beginner-friendly machine learning project that shows the workflow of building, training, and evaluating a regression model.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

â”œâ”€â”€ data/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ HousePrice DataSet.csv        # Dataset used for training
â”œâ”€â”€ Manahil_Zahid(HousePrice).ipynb   # Jupyter Notebook with model code
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md                         # Project documentation 
```

## âš¡ Features  
- Uses **house size** as the main feature to predict prices.  
- Implemented in **Python** using:  
  - `pandas` â†’ data handling  
  - `matplotlib` â†’ data visualization  
  - `scikit-learn` â†’ machine learning (Linear Regression)  

---

## ðŸ”Ž Workflow in Notebook  
1. Load and explore the dataset.  
2. Visualize the relationship between house size and price.  
3. Train a **Linear Regression** model.  
4. Evaluate the model with performance metrics.  
5. Plot predictions vs actual values.  

---

## ðŸ“Š Results  
- The model shows how **Linear Regression** can be applied to real-world price prediction.  
- Provides insights into the relationship between house size and house price.

## ðŸš€ How to Run  
1. Clone the repo  
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
```
   jupyter notebook Manahil_Zahid(HousePrice).ipynb 
```

Future Improvements

1. Add more features (e.g., location, number of rooms).

2. Compare with other regression models.

3. Deploy the model as a web app for user interaction.
